Logo provides the usual arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, denoted by the symbols `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Each of these operations produces a result. If you don't do something with the result, such as print it, Logo will show an error.

With the `print` command, the result of an arithmetic operation can be used and printed in the command window.

Example:

<!--logo {"width":"220px", "height":"220px", "code": true}-->

```
print 2 + 2
print 100 * 2 + 17
print 1000 / 3
```

Other useful math commands are:

`sqrt` − It takes one non-negative argument and returns its square root.

`power` − It takes two arguments, call them ‘a’ and ‘b’, and generates a to the b power.

`ln` − It takes one argument and returns its natural logarithm.

`exp` − It takes one argument and computes e to that power, e is the natural number `2.718281828`.

`log10` − It takes the logarithm to base 10 of its one argument.

`sin`, `cos`, `tan` - The usual trigonometry functions. Angles are in degrees.
