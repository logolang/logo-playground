Hello, I am Logo, and I can help you make some awesome things happen ðŸ˜Ž

First let me show you around and explain: The space below is my drawing box.
In the center of the drawing box is the turtle.
You can control the turtle using Logo commands.
With those commands you can use the turtle to draw beautiful shapes.
You type in the Logo commands in the box on the right which is also known as the program box.
To start typing in orders please click the mouse inside the program box.
To execute the program you need to press green button **Run** on the top of program box.

The first command you will learn will move the turtle forward.
This command is simply called **forward** followed by a number.
The number indicates how far the turtle moves forward. Let's try it:

Write down the command ```forward 50``` and execute your first program!

```init
;Please type your program here
```

```result
forward 50
```
