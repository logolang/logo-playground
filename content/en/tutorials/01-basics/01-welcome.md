Hi, welcome to the **logo playground tutorials**. Here you can learn how to use the Logo programming language and have fun at the same time.

First of all let's have a look around.

The screen section with a turtle in it is called **Drawing box**.

<!--logo {"width":"200px", "height":"150px"}-->

```
;just a turtle
```

Here you can see the results of execution of your program.
Another part of screen currently blank is called **Program box**. This is a place where you write your program code.

So, let's try this out. First, you need to type the simplest program in the program box:

```
forward 50
```

To execute this program you need to press green <span style="border: 1px solid lightgray; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">Run</span> button in the top right corner of program box.
If you have done it right then the turtle moved forward 50 steps and drew a line behind.

If you can't make it working you can press the <span style="border: 1px solid lightgray; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">Help â€“ it's not working!</span> button. It will put the correct code into the program box.

After you complete this step you can press <span style="border: 1px solid lightgray; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">Continue</span> button to navigate to next step. See you there!
