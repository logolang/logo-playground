Hi, welcome to the **logo playground tutorials**. Here you can learn how to use the Logo programming language and have fun at the same time.

First of all let's have a look around.

The screen section with a turtle ![](./turtle-small.svg) in it is called **Drawing box**.

Here you can see the results of execution of your program.
Another part of screen currently blank is called **Program box**. This is a place where you write your program code.

So, let's try this out. First, you need to type the simplest program in the program box:

```
forward 50
```

Then to execute this program you need to press green **Run** button in the top right corner.
If you have done it right then the turtle moved forward 50 steps and drew a line behind.

If you can't make it working you can press the **Help â€“ it's not working!** button. It will put the correct code into the program box.

After you complete this step you can press **Continue** button to navigate to next step. See you there!

```
forward 50
```
