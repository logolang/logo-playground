Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to perform basic manipulations with the Logo's turtle. This was a very basic example, but it did illustrate some of the key points of LOGO:

1. You can already write simple programs.
2. Result is very visual and easy to understand.
3. It is fun!

Last challenge, guess what will be drawn with this program?

```
rt 18 fd 100
rt 144 fd 100
rt 144 fd 100
rt 144 fd 100
rt 144 fd 100
```

Subsequent tutorials will take you much deeper :)
