Let's meet the new function: `home`. It moves the turtle to the center of the screen and rotates it to the default 12-o'clock position:

<!--logo {"width":"300px", "height":"200px"}-->

```
home
```

This command is a sort of shortcut because you can achieve the same effect by using combination of `setheading` and `setxy` commands:

```
setheading 0
setxy 0 0
```

Whenever you want to just move your turtle to default location on the screen you can use the `home` command.
