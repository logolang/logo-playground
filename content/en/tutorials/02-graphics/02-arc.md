So far we have drawn only straight lines, but LOGO also has embedded functionality to draw circles and segments.

The command is `arc <angle> <radius>`.

It draws an arc of a circle, with the turtle at the center, with the specified radius, starting at the turtle's heading and extending clockwise through the specified angle. The turtle does not move.

```
arc 360 100
```
